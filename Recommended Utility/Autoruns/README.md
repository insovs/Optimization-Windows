# 🔍 Autoruns — Sysinternals (Official from Microsoft)
**The go-to tool for auditing, optimizing, cleaning and securing everything that starts with Windows.**

Autoruns is a **free, official Microsoft tool** (Sysinternals suite), created by Mark Russinovich. Task Manager and MSCONFIG only show a fraction of what's actually running — Autoruns exposes **everything**: hidden registry keys, shell extensions, drivers, scheduled tasks, injected DLLs, Winsock providers, and much more.

> This is the tool used by power users to optimize their PC and by cybersecurity experts to track persistent malware.
